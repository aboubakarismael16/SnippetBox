## 📝 About <a name = "about"></a>

A web application based on [@Alex's](https://github.com/alexedwards) book *Let's Go*. The web app was fully developed using Go and taking advantage of popular packages.

With the books help I implemented:
- Database pool connection pattern that allows for easy testing - Optimized the project work flow
- Security standards, which includes: TLS, CSRF, escaping input, and session managment
- Unit and integration testing
- a cache for quicker performance.
